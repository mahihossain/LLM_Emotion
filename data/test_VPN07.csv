REST,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.

AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee moves their head down.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time.

ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight. The interviewee tilts their head to the side.     The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes. The interviewee laughs. The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes. The interviewee laughs. The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion.

AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
The current utterance is:
[Interviewee] Okay.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee moves their head to the right. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee shrugs, i.e. moves the shoulders up and down. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
The current utterance is:
[Interviewee] Okay.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] All right.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] All right.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] All right.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] All right.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] All right.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile. The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] All right.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight.   The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour.

Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] Where did you get this outfit?
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Avatar] All right.
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The current utterance is:
[Avatar] Then we want to start.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:

[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't really suit you.

The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion enjoyment at this moment in time during the job interview.   It is unclear which internal emotion the interviewee experiences at the current moment in time. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   It is unclear, whether the interviewee has the intention to maintain or to terminate the relationship with the avatar.

"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.

REST,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

REST,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

REST,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

REST,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies.

REST,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.

The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview. The interviewee consciously applied a display rule during the job interview, i.e. they consciously adapted their behavior according to the social norms in the job interview situation. The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.

The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.

WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview. The interviewee consciously applied a display rule during the job interview, i.e. they consciously adapted their behavior according to the social norms in the job interview situation. The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

WITHDRAWAL,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.

  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth. The interviewee is breathing heavily. The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
  The interviewee experienced the emotion general negative affect at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What they have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out now.
[Interviewee] Okay.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
  The interviewee experienced the emotion general negative affect at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.

AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.

In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What they have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out now.
[Interviewee] Okay.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
  The interviewee experienced the emotion general negative affect at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.

"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour.

ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What they have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out now.
[Interviewee] Okay.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight. The interviewee suppresses the appearance of a smile.  
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
  The interviewee experienced the emotion general negative affect at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 5,00119047619048 The interviewee is male.
"
AVOIDANCE,VPN07,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
