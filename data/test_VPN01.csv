REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Interviewee] Uh, that's..
The current utterance is:
[Interviewee] Uh, that's..
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
The interviewee blinks more than once in a row. The interviewee looks down. The interviewee moves their head to the left. The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee's upper body stays straight.   The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion shame/shyness at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion surprise at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: enjoyment. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour.

The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Interviewee] Uh, that's..
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't fit you at all.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks down. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion shame/shyness at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion surprise at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.

The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Interviewee] Uh, that's..
[Avatar] Somehow that doesn't fit you at all.
[Interviewee] Okay.
[Interviewee] I'm sorry.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
The interviewee blinks more than once in a row. The interviewee looks to the right. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes. The interviewee laughs. The interviewee's upper body stays straight.   The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion shame/shyness at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion surprise at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time.

Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

The interviewee has the intention to maintain the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”

Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s personal attractiveness: “Before we start, one short question: Where did you get this outfit? Somehow it doesn’t really suit you.”
The conversation history up to the current point is:

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time.

After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.

  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.

ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.

  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview.

"
REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time.

For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time.

After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

REST,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What you have said, all the other applicants have already said.

The current utterance is:
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
The eyes of the interviewee are closed. The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy.

"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.

AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What you have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out of that now.
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
The current utterance is:
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee's upper body stays straight.   The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.

The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What you have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out of that now.
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
The current utterance is:
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee's upper body stays straight.   The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee.

Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What you have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out of that now.
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
The current utterance is:
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer.   The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that reaches the eyes. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee's upper body stays straight.   The interviewee shows the Ekman expression joy.
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness.

"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion.

ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What you have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out of that now.
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.

[Interviewee] So, either they like it or not.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks to the right.   The interviewee tilts their head to the side. The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time.

During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What you have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out of that now.
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
[Interviewee] So, either they like it or not.
The current utterance is:
[Interviewee] So, either they like it or not.
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
The eyes of the interviewee are closed.   The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth. The interviewee is speaking. The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.

The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What you have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out of that now.
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
[Interviewee] So, either they like it or not.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.   The interviewee has the intention to terminate the relationship with the avatar.
The following additional personal information was collected from the interviewer:
The mindedness score of the interviewee is 4,75 The interviewee is female.
"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.

After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
The conversation history up to the current point is:
[Avatar] What you have said, all the other applicants have already said.
[Avatar] They have not really come out of that now.
[Interviewee] Okay, but I can't pull anything out of my fingers, which I didn't do before.
[Interviewee] So, either they like it or not.
The current utterance is:
[The interviewee and interviewer are silent.]
The interviewee shows the following nonverbal behavior at the current moment:
  The interviewee looks straight at the interviewer. The interviewee holds their head straight.   The interviewee shows a non-Duchenne smile, i.e. a smile that concentrates only on the mouth.   The interviewee's upper body stays straight.    
The following information was gathered from the qualitative interview after the interaction:
The interviewee experienced the emotion anger at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experienced the emotion contempt at this moment in time during the job interview. The interviewee experiences the following internal emotion at the current moment in time: shame/shyness. The interviewee was not aware of feeling ashamed during the current moment in the job interview. During the qualitative interview, the interviewee became aware that they were having the emotion shame during the current moment in the job interview.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time.

DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation.

"
DEPRECIATION,VPN01,"The prompt you will receive is from a job interview situation, in which the interviewer (an avatar) tries to induce shame in the interviewee in two subsequent situations. If shame is induced, the interviewee often neither consciously experiences this emotion nor displays this emotion to their interaction partner. Instead, shame is consciously, or unconsciously regulated by the interviewee according to a specific emotion regulation strategy. Your task is to classify which emotion regulation strategy is used by the interviewee at the current moment in time. To this end, you will receive detailed information on the interview situation, as well as the behavior shown by the interviewee at this moment in time. In the following, we explain the different sources of input information, as well as the possible emotion regulation strategies.
After the confrontation with the shame eliciting interview situations, the participants watched the recording of the job interview and introspective information was gathered from participants in qualitative interviews about their emotional experience and their applied shame regulation strategies. For your decision, we will make available the results of this qualitative interview.

In addition, we will give you a mindedness score for the interviewee. Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee
WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.
ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.
ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.
AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.
DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.
STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.
REST: No emotion regulation strategy could be identified.","We are concerned with a moment in time in the first shame induction situation. The agent tries to induce shame by attacking the interviewee’s sense of self after presenting his/her experience: “All the other applicants have already said what you said. You haven’t exactly stood out”.
