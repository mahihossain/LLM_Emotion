Higher scores in mindedness indicate a greater ability to be mindful.\n",
      "In the following we will explain the different emotion regulation strategies that can be applied by the interviewee. Your task is to decide, which of these strategies is used by the interviewee\n",
      "WITHDRAWAL: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety.\n",
      "ATTACK_OTHER: The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.\n",
      "ATTACK_SELF: The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.\n",
      "AVOIDANCE: The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions.\n",
      "DEPRECIATION: Devaluation of interaction partner due to different (or even contrary) values and ideals; Connected to pride („My values are better than yours.“); Can be in the situation (immediate confrontation with the values of the other) or retrospective (evaluation afterwards); Can also result in not feeling ashamed at all by the following mechanism: Different values imply that the self image is not touched, which in turn implies that no shame is elicited.\n",
      "STABILIZE_SELF: This is the “silver bullet” of shame regulation; No display of uncertainty; Very few emotion regulation signals (due to mature regulation); Attempt to react in a way that is compliant with the (Ideal) Self ; “It is ok that the interviewer has this opinion. But I have a different opinion.”; It is opposed to ATTACK_SELF.\n",
