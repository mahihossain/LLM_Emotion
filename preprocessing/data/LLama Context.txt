The prompt you receive is from a study where a person is interviewed and your task is to focus on the factor Emotion Regulation. Here the interviewer try to 
induce shame in the subjects, by saying different kind of shameful things. In the transcript, if you see any utterance wiht [Avatar], it is the interviewer,
you will help to findout the Emotion Regulation strategy, based on other factors, they are listed below:

There are 8 classes of non-verbal behaviour with sub-classes that you can use in your analysis. In brackets are the short explanations of the meaning of each behaviour:

For all 8 classes of non-verbal behaviour, the subclass REST is also possible. This indicates that none of the other subclasses were detected.

In addition to the non-verbal behaviour, each row contains information about the person, the persons introspection and the context:
1. The subject who performed the behaviour (column named 'session'). The 'session' column contains 10 different subjects. VPN01 in the table corresponds to 'Versuchsperson 1' and VPN02 corresponds to 'Versuchsperson 2' and so on.
2. The situation in which it occurred (column called 'Situation'). In the table, the value 'situation 1' has been abbreviated to 'S1' and the value 'situation 2' to 'S2'. 
3. The mindedness of the person (column called 'MindednessMean'). Mindedness is defined as the ability to make connections between thoughts, feelings and actions in order to learn the meaning and causes of one's experiences and behaviour. Higher scores in this column indicate a greater ability to be mindful.
4. The person's gender is male, female or rest.
5. The introspection of the person. This includes the following:
- ExperiencedEmotion1 and ExperiencedEmotion2- describes the experienced emotions
- ShameAwarenessSituation - 'yes' means that the person was aware of feeling ashamed in the situation, 'no' means that the person was not aware of feeling ashamed
- ShameAwarenessInterview - 'yes' means that the person was aware of feeling ashamed in a later interview, 'no' means that the person was not aware of feeling ashamed
- RuleDisplay - display rules are rules that define how emotions are communicated; the value "Display_Rule" mean that a display rule has been applied.
- RelationshipIntention - a person can have the intention to maintain or terminate the relationship with the interviewer, if both intentions are existing it is labeled as 'unclear'
- InternalEmotion - following internal emotions are possible: REST (none of the following emotions could be detected), SHAME_SHYNESS, UNCLEAR (it is not clear which internal emotion it is), ENJOYMENT, GPA (=general positive affect), SURPRISE
- ShameDisplay - can be open or not open (regulated shame)

"EmotionRegulation1" is the output class, that you should output when you get the context and user prompt that follows your training, this class has following properties:

- WITHDRAWAL (The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and tries to withdraw or hide from the situation. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include shame, sadness, fear, and anxiety. )

- ATTACK_OTHER (The person may – or may not – acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message, and attempts are made to make someone else feel worse. The phenomenological experience is negative; anger is directed outward, perhaps toward the source of the shaming event.)

- ATTACK_SELF (The person acknowledges the experience as negative, accepts shame’s message as valid, and turns anger inward. The phenomenological experience is negative; emotions include self-directed anger, contempt, or disgust, which magnify the impact of shame.)

- AVOIDANCE (The person typically does not acknowledge the negative experience of self, typically does not accept shame’s message as valid (denial), and attempts are made to distract the self and others from the painful feeling. The phenomenological experience becomes neutral or positive; shame may be disavowed, or overridden with joy or excitement via distractions (e.g., sex).)

- DEPRECIATION (devaluation of the other due to different values)

- STABILIZE_SELF (focus on positive selfconcept,
act compliant with self-concept)

- REST (no emotion regulation strategy could be identified) 


Here is also the previous chat history, (where it is [Avatar] it means that it is the interviewer or the avatar, if not it is the subject, transcript: REST means that there was nothing spoken):
